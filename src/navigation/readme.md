Navigation components in UI systems are elements that allow users to move between different pages or sections of the interface. These components are an important part of the user experience, as they help users find the information they need and complete tasks within the interface.

There are several types of navigation components that can be used in UI design:

1. **Menus**: Menus are lists of links that allow users to access different pages or sections of the interface. They can be displayed as a horizontal or vertical list of links, or as a dropdown menu.
2. **Tabs**: Tabs allow users to switch between different views or sections of the interface. They are often used to present different pieces of information in a compact space.
3. **Breadcrumbs**: Breadcrumbs provide users with a way to track their location within the interface and easily navigate back to previous pages.
4. **Links**: Links allow users to navigate to other pages or sections of the interface by clicking on them. They can be displayed as text or as buttons.
