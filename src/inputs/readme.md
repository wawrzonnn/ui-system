**Inputs** are a fundamental part of any UI system, as they allow users to input data and interact with the system. Inputs can take many forms, including text fields, checkboxes, radio buttons, dropdown menus, and more.

One of the main purposes of inputs in a UI system is to collect and validate user input. This can involve ensuring that the input is in the correct format (e.g. a valid email address or phone number), or verifying that the input meets certain criteria (e.g. a password that is at least 8 characters long).

Inputs can also be used to trigger actions within the system. For example, a "submit" button might be used to submit a form or send data to the server, or a "search" button might be used to initiate a search query.

In addition to their functional aspects, inputs are also an important part of the overall design of a UI. They should be visually appealing, intuitive to use, and easy to access.
